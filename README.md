## ✨ The Aesthetic Experience

Welcome to **Nexus**. This isn't just a dashboard; it's a command center for your life's choices. Built with the **"Midnight Aurora"** design philosophy, it features:

*   **🌌 Antigravity Flow**: A living, breathing particle background that reacts to your presence.
*   **🔦 Spotlight Interface**: Interactive glassmorphic cards that glow and tilt as you navigate.
*   **🔮 Deep Space Mode**: A true dark theme designed for late-night strategists.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 The Decision Wizard
Don't just choose. *Synthesize*.
*   **Structured Thinking**: Break down complex problems into options, pros, cons, and assumptions.
*   **Confidence Calibration**: Commit to a probability score (0-100%) and track your accuracy over time.

### ⏱️ Time-Travel Review
*   **Outcome Tracking**: Revisit decisions after the dust settles. Was it a good call? Or just good luck?
*   **Assumption Validator**: Check if your beliefs held true against reality.

### 📊 The Dashboard
*   **Bento Grid Layout**: A highly modular, responsive overview of your cognitive performance.
*   **Real-time Analytics**: Visual feedback loops on your decision quality and calibration.
